This was taken from https://data-flair.training/blogs/cartoonify-image-opencv-python/

I'm using Python 3.11 installed through the Windows store. I have had to run the following to get it to work:
pip install opencv-python
pip install easygui
pip install imageio
pip install matplotlib

To run this, at the prompt type 
python cartoon.py

and choose a file. This works best with profile pictures.
